Programs showcasing my attempt to fulfill the tasks done by a typical self driving car

Stay_in_line.py uses openCV to detect the lines on a road and computes the angle of the center lane, the lane that divide
the side of the roads. 

Traffic.py and sign_detection.py use keras and yolov5 to recognize traffic signs on the road. Models are not fully implemented yet.
